## Introduction

StudyNotion aims to provide a seamless and interactive learning experience for students, making education more accessible and engaging. Additionally, the platform serves as a platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect with learners across the globe.

In the following sections, we will cover the technical details of the platform, including the system architecture, API design, installation, usage instructions, and potential future enhancements.

### Front-end

The front-end of the platform is built using ReactJS, which allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, crucial for providing an engaging learning experience to students. The front-end communicates with the back-end using RESTful API calls.

#### Front End Pages

For Students:

- **Homepage:** A brief introduction to the platform with links to the course list and user details.
- **Course List:** A list of all the courses available on the platform, along with their descriptions and ratings.
- **Wishlist:** Displays all the courses that a student has added to their wishlist.
- **Cart Checkout:** Allows the user to complete course purchases.
- **Course Content:** Presents the course content for a particular course, including videos and related material.
- **User Details:** Provides details about the student's account, including their name, email, and other relevant information.
- **User Edit Details:** Allows students to edit their account details.

For Instructors:

- **Dashboard:** Offers an overview of the instructor's courses, along with ratings and feedback for each course.
- **Insights:** Provides detailed insights into the instructor's courses, including the number of views, clicks, and other relevant metrics.
- **Course Management Pages:** Enables instructors to create, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and pricing.
- **View and Edit Profile Details:** Allows instructors to view and edit their account details.

#### Front-end Tools and Libraries

To build the front-end, we use frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, CSS, and Tailwind for styling, and Redux for state management.

### Back-end

The back-end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing APIs for the front-end to consume. These APIs include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back-end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.

#### Back-end Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and passwords. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
- **Course Management:** Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.
- **Payment Integration:** Students will purchase and enroll in courses by completing the checkout flow, followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.
- **Cloud-based Media Management:** StudyNotion uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.
- **Markdown Formatting:** Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, allowing for easier display and rendering on the front-end.

#### Back-end Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools

The back-end of StudyNotion uses various frameworks, libraries, and tools to ensure its functionality and performance, including:

- **Node.js:** Used as the primary framework for the back-end.
- **Express.js:** Used as a web application framework, providing a range of features and tools for building web applications.
- **MongoDB:** Used as the primary database, providing a flexible and scalable data storage solution.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user credentials.
- **Bcrypt:** Used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data.
- **Mongoose:** Used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a way to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript.
